The basics: I’am a classic 80s geek, growing up with my Commodore 64 and learning my first lines of code with the ultra-modern languages “Pascal” and “Basic”. When I got my first PC in the early 90s, I switched from programming to understanding operating systems and hardware.

And then I discoverd the internet… and HTML and CSS (we throw a big veil of silence over my first so-called websites).</p>
<p>However: professionally I was pretty sure that I will never succeed in the it/dev-wworld (and yeah… it wasn’t really commonfor a girl in that time to go that way, so the support wasn’t the biggest). So instead of studing “IT” at the university, I studied a number of humanities and got my master degree in history, linguistics and literary studies. To be honest I loved studying, but have never worked in this area until today. In order not to be unemployed while looking for my future “real” job, I took a temporary one and ended up with a PC, web applications, automation and an IT infrastructure … Long story short: I got an additional degree as computer scientist and worked as a developer, team leader, senior web developer, project manager and Head of IT since.</p>
<p>Why do I love my Job? Code doesn’t know the word “limit”. There is a solution to every problem. Ok: to ALMOST every problem. This is very soothing and one can concentrate on the “how” and not on the “if”. And I find it still fascinating that simple combinations of “on” and “off” can lead to things like scripts, programs, games and websites.</p>

A few times I worked with clients who first had to gain trust after hearing that I’m not only a programmer or administrative project manager, but also the technical leader.</p>
<p>So with tongue-in-cheek I thought: If people a girly girl, they get one, and made pink my preferred color (it&#39;s not even my favorite color in real life).

An of course my IDE-Theme turned pink (as a dark mode fan since ever it surely has a brillant contrast…).
