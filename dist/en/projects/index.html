The projects developed during working hours are therefore not my own. As for my private projects, it is the well-known dilemma: old projects are too &quot;embarrassing&quot; to show because they are out of date. Newer projects are never completely &quot;finished&quot;.
In order to give an insight into my way of working and y experience, I will show you a few of my latest private projects, but some of them are still WIPs. I also describe selected projects in which I was involved during a job without linking to end customers, naming them or showing screenshots.</p></div><div class="work-group" data-v-2f824ac8 data-v-02567b62><h2 class="work-group__title" data-v-2f824ac8>Current private projects</h2><p class="work-group__description" data-v-2f824ac8>Since I have only recently found the courage to go public with my own things. there are only a few entries here.
